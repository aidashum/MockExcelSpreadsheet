How we Styled our game:
- Function, Reference class and Value interface extends the formula Interface
- ValueBoolean, ValueString, ValueDouble implement the Value Interface
- Transfrom to Formula implements the SexpVisitor
-
-we created a visitor for the Formula types in order to go through a given function especially.
-we also created a visitor for the Values.
